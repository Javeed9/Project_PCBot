you

jazzmin hi my name is IDM your counselor

today we're going to meet in a room to

our left something a bit more private

than this area out here should we go

there now yeah let's go

so we're just going to go up the hall

and to the right and then there's a room

on the left should I go first okay come

in Jasmine this is the room that we'll

be meeting in today and if you come back

again we'll be in this room again what I

want you to do first is perhaps have a

look around and choose where you would

like to sit where you'd like to be just

the big chair over there yeah so when

you're ready just make your way over to

the chair and I'll close the door and

from where you're sitting now where do

you think you'd like me to be in the

room which chair would you like me to

sit in not on in this chair here yeah I

can I've got your drink of order just

move my chair round

to face you that's all right how's the

distance between us would you like more

room would you like me further back or

more forward that's like--that's okay

okay so I want to invite you here to

look around look around the room take in

this new space you've never been here

before

see if there's something your eyes want

to rest on or if there's anything

Pleasant - your eyes have a really good

stickybeak around the room most people

most times we come into new environments

we want to have a good stickybeak in my

diet and you can in here I imagine it's

pretty tough for you to be here yeah

yeah

what would help you to spend a moment

here if you love you took hold of that

pillow yeah what's it like to have that

pillow against your tummy it's nice yeah

what's it like to have your hands

holding tight there like that does that

help you to be here yeah how did you how

did you get here my mom dropped me home

here here I'm doctor she's still here no

she's not here is there an arrangement

to pick you up yeah yep

man you're looking at the time so what

time did you arrange for mom to pick you

up um like half now in half an hour yeah

yeah yeah so notice you're looking

around a little bit more now helps a bit

more with that pillow doesn't it that

was a good idea for you to put the

pillow there yeah so how long do you

think you'd like to be here if you had a

choice of how long you were going to be

here with me in this conversation how

long would it be

maybe love another 15 minutes maybe

another 15 minutes yeah okay maybe maybe

if we just took then that 15 minutes

just to get used to the room just to get

used to being in this space being in

that chair with what it's like to have

your feet on the ground what's it like

to feel your seat when you're back on

the chair with the support of that

pillow that was such a good idea to get

that pillow it's a good resource yeah

because it's helping you to be here yeah

so notice how it's a struggle to be here

but there's still something that helps

you to be here so on one hand there's a

struggle and on the other hand there's

some kind of a little bit of support

even if it's a tiny bit takes the edge

off because if both is there in the room

yeah what's it like for you to consider

that it's not going to be half now that

it's going to be 15 minutes now I feel

better

feel better mmm yep we can just call mom

and tell her that the first session is

shorter yeah because it's enough how

it's really confronting to be here a lot

of people find it confronting to come

here because of the name of the agency

the issues that we may talk about in the

future it's pretty confronting so just

getting used to being here is a pretty

big deal and you're doing a great job

you're doing really well

yeah and I'm here with you
