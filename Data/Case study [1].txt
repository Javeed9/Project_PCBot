hi nice to meet you hey so I

understand that you referred here by

your GP because you've been feeling

quite down recently yeah I thought I

should I've been feeling quite bad for

quite a while so I thought maybe it's

time to see someone about it because I

don't want to feel like this anymore

okay so um from your notes I saw that

you saw the GP about three months ago

yeah and how long have you been feeling

down altogether and quite a few months

before that as well actually but it's

gotten pretty bad these past few months

so that's kind of why I came

okay so as it got worse since you saw

your gear yeah okay so tell me haven't

health how are things at the moment and

well it kind of started just feeling a

bit low and wound up about things but I

don't know just recently I I just can't

really be bothered to do anything at all

it kind of find it hard to get motivated

for things and I want to be I really

want to be better but it's just kind of

reaching the hem now or I just I want to

do something about it okay so you said

that you're feeling really down really

sad yeah and you feel like you haven't

got any motivation um but are you okay

yeah okay and you haven't got any

motivation but it sounds like you've put

quite a lot of pressure on yourself to

try and feel a bit better yeah I just

it's kind of hard as well because

there's not really anyone to talk about

some it just kind of stay on my own try

to I don't like to think about it but

actually so you say you've been feeling

quite isolated there's not many people

around yeah no one I can talk to about

it

don't listen I understand anyway okay so

I'm just going to try and find out a

little bit more about you so I

understand that you're an English

student at uni yeah and you live away

from home with some friends is that

right yeah

yeah okay so you don't you don't it far

from the Uni and but you say you feel

like you live with your friends but you

don't feel like you can talk to them

yeah I mean they're lovely I get on

really well with them but I don't know I

just recently whenever they want to go

out or stuff I just I don't want to

bring them down I can't they don't

understand what I'm going to they kind

of I didn't they didn't make fun of how

I feel but you don't really understand

what it's like I don't want to go out

with them and bring them down stuff okay

so it sounds do you try and hide the way

you're feeling from them I guess I mean

it's easier to hide it then to try to

explain it all the time when Lo and

Brady wants to know okay so it sounds

like you've been feeling down you've

been feeling unmotivated and you feel

like you want to be better but actually

it sounds like you feel like you can't

reach out for help you can't speak to

anybody no I don't really talk to my

parents about ether how's their hair

kind of hard okay I'm just going to go

back in time another suppose I'm just

wondering when when did all of this

start you said it's been going on for

quite a few months yeah um I guess it

kind of started when I was actually when

I was revising for my exams um I guess

the stress I put a lot of stress on

myself I think I've always wanted to do

well for me and I guess my parents so

the stress of exams and it was also kind

of hard because my parents were going

through a little bit a troubled time

limit so okay so this would be like last

March last April yeah take so around

that time so about six months ish and it

sounds like a lot was happening so you

had a lot of uni pressure on and he said

that your parents were having marital

problems

okay and it sounds like that was a real

shock to you yeah I guess it was hard as

well because I wasn't doing well at uni

any I guess I just felt a bit guilty I I

know it sounds silly but I felt like

maybe if I could do better than they

would get better but I didn't it just

wasn't really happening okay so it

sounds like you were trying to work hard

and be more successful because you

thought that that would make them

happier and try and fix things yeah I

wanted to make them feel better but it

just kind of kept fied a little I guess

how did it backfire well it just ended

up with them getting worse and I've just

been feeling worse since then okay so

after the summer after the exam period

and how did that exam period go for you

in the end

not very well hey there's an awful lot

of pressure to put on yourself you

supposed to she's just annoying because

I know I should have done better and I

just didn't and I guess I beat myself up

a lot of hmm so you say I know I know I

should have done better I mean I suppose

up hearing it from my perspective I'm

thinking it sounds like you had an awful

lot going on at the time it'd be

understandable absolutely that you

wouldn't do as well as normal I suppose

I'm just wondering if you have very high

standards for yourself properly it may

be more than other people my parents

have always kind of taught me not in a

loving way I guess but that you should

do your best but also get the best and I

agree with that I think that's the right

thing to think but when I don't do that

I don't know it annoys me a lot and I

worried that it annoys them so it sounds

like you feel you should always do your

best

already is yeah and that there isn't any

kind of exceptions for that but you know

okay

and so I can I can see then that was a

really difficult time for you and that

was when your moods started to get lower

and things are still

quite bad now I mean what's the

situation with your parents at the

moment um I think it doesn't sound good

I don't really talk to them a lot but I

don't think they're going through very

good I don't like to talk to them about

it because it just makes me feel worse

but I don't think it's getting any

better you home over the summer for a

little bit yeah and how is that not very

fun no hmm it was quite tense all the

time

stressed me out more than relaxed me

over the summer idea mm-hmm okay

okay so it sounds like quite a lot has

been happening you've been feeling very

low you've had a uni pressure on and

we've had problems with your parents

marriage and sounds like you feel that

you can't really reach out to anyone

that you can't understand but you can't

really reach out to your parents right

now

you can't really confide in your friends

and so I suppose I'm just wondering if

you can tell me a bit more about how

you've been feeling I mean say this past

week and really not good to be honest I

actually if I don't have to though I

don't really leave the house or get out

of but I just I can't find the

motivation for the things I used to join

them I used to love doing sports or

going out and now I just prefer to lie

in bed and not really do anything okay I

missed a few lectures this week that I

should have gone to but right so I

suppose I'm just wondering then it's as

if we can think about one thing say a

lecture what kind of thoughts do you

have about going to our lecture before

it happens I don't really see the point

anymore

if if I can't do as well as I should be

doing then what's the point in putting

myself in those positions I just I can't

be bothered anymore to try it just

stresses me out more than I need to do

okay so it sounds like the kind of

thoughts you've got in your head are

it's pointless and it's not worth it

yeah do you have any other thoughts in

your head when you're just at that point

before you go to the lek

so like I dunno I I don't really even

deserve to be here if I can't do well

enough I see all these other students so

doing well and doing better and want to

be there I don't know why I'm here even

that you need to be so it sounds like

you feel like you're not as good as

other people here yeah okay um I'm just

as sorry okay if I take this as we go

through it's just I'm trying to em I

guess understand what you're telling me

and it helps me just to write it down

and I'll share this with you later

okay so it sounds like those are those

are some quite negative thoughts to have

you're kind of saying you know it feels

like it's pointless it's more effort

than it's worth

and I don't deserve to be here I mean

when you have those thoughts how do you

feel very unworthy probably would be the

best way to put it kind of I don't know

lower than normal because then it makes

me think about all the things I should

have been doing better okay so what you

described there then he said I'm

unworthy I should be doing lots of

things better and those are kind of what

I would call thoughts actually I suppose

I'm trying to understand what it feels

like in your gut what kind of emotions

do you feel happier do you feel sad do

you what kind of emotions you feeling

when you have those thoughts sad you

don't happiness very sad a bit of kind

of anger and frustration as well

I noticed when you're kind of telling me

this and I know this is quite a heavy

topic but you're kind of laughing and I

suppose I wonder a little bit you a bit

you know how do you feel about having

these emotions talking about these

emotions yes

embarrassed mm-hmm but is it I've never

yet to talk about it's it's quite

uncomfortable to be in this situation

okay were you doing a great job I know I

know that this can be difficult okay so

it sounds like some of the thoughts

you're describing our it's pointless

it's more than it's worth I don't

deserve to be here I'm unworthy and

those kind of thoughts it sounds like

they just flip through your mind and and

then he's kind of describing different

emotions that those lead to kind of

scramming sad anger frustration

embarrassed what about in your body what

happens how do you feel kind of

physically I used to be I think from

those emotions very wound up very kind

of stressed all the time but recently

it's just a lot more draining than

anything just quite lethargic and I

can't be bothered anymore in it my body

reflects that but then when I try and

sleep I just can't seem to have a

satisfied night's sleep

it's really really frustrating so it

sounds like this is affecting as it's

draining you if your energy like like

your body can't be bothered I think

that's a really good way of describing

it and you're noticing sleep problems as

well and then what do you do so this is

so we're back to the point before the

lecture so you start having these

thoughts these emotions and you know

your body I guess it sounds like those

thoughts quite draining so we draining

your energy what then happens what you

do next

and

I kind of focus on the negative thoughts

when I probably should not think about

them but it I focus on them and then I

don't really want to do anything can I

stay in bed or so you think even more

about this kind of warring so you have

to do a bit of dwelling and you stay in

bed and it sounds like you don't you

know you haven't tried speaking to your

friends about it no family okay and then

after you've done that so after you've

not gone to the lecture you've stayed in

bed you kind of spent time as you said

focusing on those those thoughts those

negative thoughts how do you feel after

that to feel better or do you feel worse

I guess I fill up slightly worse but

then a bit numb in a way kind of once

you've felt that because I do feel tired

all the time I just try and push it out

and then you don't really think about

anything and it's almost nicer that way

than to keep focusing on how much you're

getting wrong and how much you can't do

stuff sometimes it's better just to not

think about it at all so it sounds like

in some ways it's a bit of a relief to

do that yeah but in other ways maybe

think it might make things worse

probably in the long run yeah

you
